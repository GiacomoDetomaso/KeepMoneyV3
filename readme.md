# KeepMoney
The third version of KeepMoney: an app that allows you to keep track of your incomes and purchases.

### Note
This version is just a DEMO used for a university exam. A lot of things should improve, starting from the UI and the UX. I'm looking forward to develop a new improved version of this application (maybe using Flutter framework), with a cleaner code and an improved user experience.
